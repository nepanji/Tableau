# Tableau - Citi Bike Annual Snapshot

## Overview
In this assignment, I was given the task of generating a dashboard report for city officials looking to publicize
and improve the city bike sharing program. The set of data reports will be built from the New York Citi Bike
Program tha has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization.  

## Tasks

### Step 1: Data Preparation
The files are saved for each year by month. A format change occured in the 2021 csv data files starting with February. 
I used a small extract of data from 2019 to build initial drafts of the data reports. Jupyter Notebook was used to clean and 
combine the csv files for 2019.

### Step 2: Data Visualizations
Several design visualizations were designed to explore potential phenomena:
  * Top Ciki Bike Station's by total number of trips based on Bike IDs

  * Top users of the bike sharing program based on users' age, distance traveled, and tripduration

  * Peak usage for the programs based time of day and season

  * Top 10 Start Stations and Top 10 End Stations 

The final Tableau Public workbook produced includes:
  * 13 Total "Phenomenon" Visualizations
  * 5 Dashboards
  * 3 City Official Map
  * 1 Story 

### Step 3: Data Analysis
Citi Bike Summary (2019 New York Metro)
    * Total Trips Taken:  404,947 
    * Total # of Bikes Used:  610
    * Total # of Miles Traveled:  357,864,748

Most Active Participants: 
    *  by User Type: Subscribers  
    *  by Age Group: 26-35  
    *  by Month: August       
    *  by Gender: Male
        
Most Annual Usage by Gender and Age Group:
    *  Female: 26-35
    *  Male: 36-45

Least Annual Usage by Gender and Age Group:
    *  Female: 19-25
    *  Male: 66 and up
